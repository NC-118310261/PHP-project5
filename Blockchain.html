        <p style="background-color:pink;text-align:center;">Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.<br>
            The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto.<br> But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?<br>

            By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet.<br> Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin, the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology.</p>
