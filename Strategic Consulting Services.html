        <h2 style="color:pink;text-align:center;">Blockchain</h2>
        
        <p style="background-color:pink;text-align:center;">Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.<br>
            The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto.<br> But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?<br>

            By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet.<br> Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin, the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology.</p>

    <h2 style="color:lightblue;text-align:center;">Autonomous Things</h2>
    <p style="background-color:lightblue;text-align:center;">Autonomous things is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.<br> 
        Self-navigating drones are the first Autonomous technology in deployment.<br> It is expected that the first mass-deployment of Autonomous technologies will be the autonomous car, generally expected to be available around 2020.<br> Other currently expected Autonomous technologies include home robotics (e.g., machines that provide care for the elderly, infirm or young), and military robots (air, land or sea autonomous machines with information-collection or target-attack capabilities). <br>
        Autonomous technologies share many common traits, which justify the common notation. <br>They are all based on recent breakthroughs in the domains of (deep) machine learning and artificial intelligence.<br>  They all require extensive and prompt regulatory developments to specify the requirements from them and to license and manage their deployment.<br> And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., automobile safety) and security,to overcome concerns about the potential negative impact of the new technology.</p>

            <h2 style="color:orange;text-align:center;">Immersive Experiences</h2>
        <p style="background-color:orange;text-align:center;">There are two types of immersive experiences, one being when you are actually in a physical environment and the other where you are shown around a real or imagined environment via desktop, tablet, mobile or via VR ( Virtual Reality) headset. At Vismedia we specialise in the latter.<br>
            Our immersive experiences enable the viewer to explore spaces through a series of interconnected 360° environments into which you can place traditional 2D video and animation content alongside interactive hotspots and overlays, links to internal and external websites and downloadable documentation.<br>

            With immersion come several other terms that merit explanation.<br>
            The media likes to talk about (and use – often incompetently) Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR), among other terms.<br>

            Though they sometimes use these interchangeably, there are differences between all of these terms.<br>

            When we talk about Virtual Reality, we are describing a fully constructed CGI digital world into which you place the user and which they can interact with.<br>
            All of the contents of the world are man-made and rendered as needed.<br>

            360° Video or 360° Photography create environments that have been digitally captured from the real world, allowing the user to be placed inside and to feel a part of the captured moment from a more passive perspective.<br>

            An immersive experience can be delivered via desktop, tablet and mobile and because it is a 360° environment it can easily be transferred into a VR headset environment.<br>
            So although not by definition Virtual Reality it is enabled via a VR headset.

            Augmented Reality, on the other hand, is a combination of the real world and certain digital elements.<br>
            The most well-known example of AR is certainly the mobile game Pokemon Go.<br>
            This is where objects are placed according to GPS or geolocated co-ordinates.<br>
            However increasingly we are seeing AR been used to overlay additional moving content to static flat content.<br>
            For example we recently worked with Unilever to bring an internal poster campaign to life by having animations that sat behind the posters and which were activated by holding the phone over the images.<br>
            The AR overlay also enabled to viewer to visit specific internal websites which were accessible by an AR click through button.<br>
            Simple but effective and also very measurable via back end analytics.<br>
            Finally, Mixed Reality is perhaps the most exciting of the three.<br>
            It’s basically a mix of holographic and virtual images, and the user wears special glasses to see it.<br>
            Many consider this to be the future of gaming (and a whole plethora of additional use cases)</p>
