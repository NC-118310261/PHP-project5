        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:arial;">London</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-family:arial;">I travelled to London with my mom during my Christmas holidays in 2018.<br> 
            We stayed four nights in London City. <br>
            It is a lovely place.<br>
            We visited the shops on Oxford Street and Regent Street.<br>
            We also took a trip to Buckingham Palace to see where the Queen of England lives.<br>
            It is a beautiful building.<br>
            We also visited to famous shop Harrods.<br>
            It is a very big shop.<br>
            We went to see the West End show, Les Miserables, in The Queens Theatre.<br>
            It was an amazing performance.<br>
